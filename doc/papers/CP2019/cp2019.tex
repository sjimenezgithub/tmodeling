\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

{\em Automated planning} is the model-based approach for the task of selecting the actions that achieve a given goal starting from a given initial state. {\em Classical planning} is considered the vanilla model for automated planning and it assumes: fully observable states under a deterministic world, instantaneous actions, and goal conditions that exclusively refer to the last state reached by a plan~\cite{geffner2013concise,ghallab2004automated}.

Beyond classical planning, there is a bunch of planning models that relax the assumptions of classical planning to compute more detailed solutions than classical plans~\cite{ghallab2004automated}. This work focuses on the {\em temporal planning} model that relaxes the assumption of {\em instantaneous actions}~\cite{fox2003pddl2}. Actions in temporal planning are {\em durative}, which means that they have a duration and that the conditions/effects of actions must hold/happen at different times during the action execution. As a consequence, {\em durative actions} can be executed in parallel and overlap in several ways and {\em temporal plans} indicate the precise time-stamp when durative actions start and end~\cite{howey2004val,cushing2007temporal}.

Despite the performance and potential of state-of-the-art planners, its applicability to real-world tasks is still somewhat limited because of the difficulty of specifying correct and complete planning models~\cite{kambhampati2007model}. The more expressive the planning model is, the more evident becomes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck, which jeopardizes the usability of AI planning technology. This fact has led to a growing interest in the planning community for the learning of action models~\cite{jimenez2012review,arora2018review}. The objective of this learning task is to compute the actions' conditions and effects that are {\em consistent} with a set of observations (defined as some sequence of state changes, world transitions, expert demonstrations or plan traces/logs). Observation of past behavior provide indirect, but very valuable information to hypothesize the action models, thus helping future planning decisions and recommendations. Beyond plan synthesis the learning of action models from observations is also interesting for proactive assistants when recognizing activities of (human or software) agents to assist them in their daily activities and, as the last frontier, to predict and anticipate their needs or actions.

Most approaches for learning planning action models are purely inductive and often require large datasets of observations, e.g. thousands of plan observations to compute a statistically significant model that minimizes some error metric over the observations~\cite{kuvcera2018louga,MouraoZPS12,yang2007learning,zhuo2013action}. Defining model learning as an optimization task over a set of observations does not guarantee correctness (the learned models may fail to explain all the observations). This paper analyzes the application of {\em Constraint Programming} (CP) for the {\em one-shot learning} of temporal action models, that is, the extreme case of learning durative action models from a single partial observation of the execution of a temporal plan. In this work we assume that the given input observation is partial but noiseless, meaning that if a value is observed, then the observation is correct.

Despite the learning of classical action models has previously been addressed by different approaches; to our knowledge none learns the temporal features. This involves: i) identifying how the action conditions and effects are temporally distributed within the action execution, and ii) estimate the action duration. Further, observations may refer to the execution of concurrent actions which makes our approach suitable for learning in multi-agent environments. Last but not least, our CP-based approach evidences that learning {\em durative} action models strongly resembles the task of synthesizing and validating temporal plans that satisfy a given set constraints imposed by the input observations. 

As a motivating example, let us assume a logistics plan trace. Learning the temporal planning model from this single observation will allow us: i) to better understand the insights of the logistics scenario in terms of what is possible (or not) and why, because the model is consistent with the observed data; ii) to suggest changes that can improve the model originally created by a human, e.g. re-distributing the action's conditions, provided they still explain the observations; and iii) to automatically elaborate similar models for similar scenarios, such as public transit for commuters, tourists or people in general in metropolitan areas (\emph{a.k.a.} smart urban mobility).

\section{Background and Terminology}
\label{sec:background}

This section formalizes the classical+temporal planning models, the Constraint Satisfaction Problem and the learning task, as they will be used in the paper.

\subsection{Classical Planning}
\label{sec:classicalplanning}
Let $F$ be a set of facts that represent propositional variables.
%Without loss of generality, we assume that $F$ does not contain conflicting values $f$ and $\neg f$.
A state $s$ is a full assignment of values to variables, $|s|=|F|$, so the size of the state space is $2^{|F|}$.
A {\em classical planning problem} is a tuple $\tup{F,I,G,A}$, where $I$ is a state that represents the initial state, $G \subseteq F$ is a set of goal conditions over $F$, and $A$ is the set of actions that modify states. We assume that actions are grounded from given action schemas, as in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language~\cite{fox2003pddl2,Ghallab98,ghallab2004automated}).

Each action $a \in A$ has a set of preconditions $\pre(a)$ and a set of effects $\eff(a)$; $\pre(a), \eff(a) \subseteq F$. $\pre(a)$ must hold before $a$ starts (this is why they are named \emph{pre}conditions), whereas $\eff(a)$ happen when $a$ ends. This way, $a$ is applicable in a state $s$ if $\pre(a) \subseteq s$. When $a$ is executed, a new state, the successor of $s$, is created that results of applying $\eff(a)$ on $s$. Typically, $\eff(a)$ is formed by positive and negative/delete effects. Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleactions1} shows an example of two action scheme for the actions of the \emph{driverlog} domain taken from the International Planning Competition\footnote{IPC, \texttt{http://www.icaps-conference.org/index.php/Main/Competitions}}. The schema \texttt{board-truck} is used to board a driver on an empty truck at a given location. In \texttt{drive-truck} a truck is driven between two locations, provided there is a link between them.

\end{verbatim}
\end{tabular}

\end{figure}


In this work we define a plan for a classical planning problem as a set of pairs $\tup{(a_1,t_1),(a_2,t_2)\ldots (a_n,t_n)}$. Each $(a_i,t_i)$ pair contains an instantaneous action $a_i$ and the planning step $t_i$ when $a_i$ starts. This action sequence induces a state sequence $\tup{s_1,s_2\ldots s_n}$, where each $a_i$ is applicable in $s_{i-1}$, being $s_0=I$, and generates state $s_i$. In every valid plan $G\subseteq s_n$, i.e. the goal condition is satisfied in the last state. %In general terms, classical plans can be sequential plans, where only one action is executed at each planning step, or parallel plans, where several actions can be executed at the same planning step.

\subsection{Temporal Planning}
\label{sec:temporalplanning}

A {\em temporal planning problem} is also a tuple $\tup{F,I,G,A}$ where $F$, $I$ and $G$ are defined like in the classical planning model, but $A$ represents now a set of {\em durative actions}. There are several options that allow for a high expressiveness of durative actions. On the one hand, durative actions can have a fixed duration, a duration that ranges within an interval or a distribution of durations. On the other hand, actions may have conditions/effects at different times, such as conditions that must hold some time before the action starts, effects that happen just when the action starts, in the middle of the action or some time after the action finishes~\cite{garrido2009constraint}.

A popular model for temporal planning is given by PDDL2.1~\cite{fox2003pddl2}, a language that somewhat restricts temporal expressiveness, and that defines a durative action as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item $\dur(a)$, a positive value for the action duration.

\item $\cond_s(a), \cond_o(a), \cond_e(a) \subseteq F$. Unlike the \emph{pre}conditions of a classical action, now conditions must hold when $a$ starts ({\em at start}), during the entire execution of $a$ ({\em over all}) or when $a$ finishes ({\em at end}), respectively. In the general case, $\cond_s(a) \cup \cond_o(a) \cup \cond_e(a) = \pre(a)$\footnote{Note that in classical planning $pre(a)=\{p,\neg p\}$ is contradictory, but in temporal planning, $\cond_s(a)=\{p\}$ and $\cond_e(a)=\{\neg p\}$ is a possible, though unusual, situation}.
%Note that $\cond_s(a) \cup \cond_o(a) \cup \cond_e(a) \subseteq \pre(a)$, since $\cond_s(a)=\{p\}$ and $\cond_e(a)=\{not-p\}$ is, for instance, now possible.


\item $\eff_s(a)$ and $\eff_e(a)$. Now effects can happen {\em at start} or {\em at end} of $a$, respectively, and can still be positive or negative. Again, in the general case $\eff_s(a) \cup \eff_e(a) = \eff(a)$.
%Again, $\eff_s(a) \cup \eff_e(a) \subseteq \eff(a)$.

\end{itemize}


%Despite durative actions are no longer instantaneous in PDDL2.1, {\em at start} and {\em at end} conditions are checked instantaneously.

The semantics of a durative action $a$ can be defined in terms of two discrete events, $\start(a)$ and $\en(a)=\start(a)+\dur(a)$. This means that if action $a$ starts on state $s$, $\cond_s(a)$ must hold in $s$, and ending $a$ in state $s'$ means $\cond_e(a)$ holds in $s'$. {\em Over all} conditions must hold at any state between $s$ and $s'$ or, in other words, throughout interval $[\start(a),\en(a)]$.
Analogously, {\em at start} and {\em at end} effects are instantaneously applied at states $s$ and $s'$, respectively ---continuous effects are not considered.
Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleactions2} shows two durative actions that extend the classical actions of Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleactions1}. Now \texttt{board-truck} has a fixed duration whereas in \texttt{drive-truck} the duration depends on the locations.

\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{p{\textwidth}}
\begin{verbatim}

  :duration (= ?duration 2)

                  (over all (at ?t ?l)))
  :effect (and (at start (not (at ?d ?l))) (at start (not (empty ?t)))
               (at end (driving ?d ?t))))

(:durative-action drive-truck

                  (over all (driving ?d ?t)))
  :effect (and (at start (not (at ?t ?from))) (at end (at ?t ?to))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{tabular}

%PDDL2.2 is an extension of PDDL2.1 that includes the notion of {\em Timed Initial Literal}~\cite{hoffmann2005} ($\til(f,t)$), as a way of defining a fact $f\in F$ that becomes true at a certain time $t$, independently of the actions in the plan. TILs are useful to define exogenous happenings; for instance, a time window when a warehouse is open in a logistics scenario ($\til(open,8)$ and $\til(\neg open,20)$).


A temporal plan is a set of pairs $\tup{(a_1,t_1),(a_2,t_2)\ldots (a_n,t_n)}$. Each $(a_i,t_i)$ pair contains a durative action $a_i$ and $t_i=\start(a_i)$.
This temporal plan induces a state sequence formed by the union of all states $\{s_{t_i}, s_{t_i+\dur(a_i)}\}$, where $s_{t_0}=I$ and $G\subseteq s_{t_n}$, being $s_{t_n}$ the last state induced by the plan.
Though a sequential temporal plan is syntactically possible, it is semantically useless. Consequently, temporal plans are always given as parallel plans.


\section{One-Shot Learning of Temporal Action Models}
  \label{sec:learningtask}
  We define the task of the one-shot learning of a temporal action model as a tuple $\tup{F,I,G,A[\cdot],O}$, where:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\tup{F,I,G,A[\cdot]}$ is a temporal planning problem in which actions are partially specified.  Actions in $A[\cdot]$ are partially specified because we do not know the structure in terms of their distribution of conditions/effects nor their duration. For each action $a \in A[\cdot]$, we only know the sets $\pre(a)=(\cond_s(a) \cup \cond_o(a) \cup \cond_e(a))$ and $\eff(a)=(\eff_s(a) \cup \eff_e(a))$, as this information can be extracted from the classical version of the planning problem, from prior knowledge we have on the problem, or given by an expert. 
  \item $O$ is the single sequence of observations corresponding to a plan trace and contains the time when action $a$ in $A[\cdot]$ started, i.e. all $\start(a)$ that have been observed (by a sensor or human observer).    
  \end{itemize}    

  A solution to this learning task is a fully specified model of temporal actions $\mathcal{A}$, with all actions of $A[\cdot]$, where the duration and distribution of conditions/effects is completely specified, as defined in section~\ref{sec:temporalplanning}. Every action in $\mathcal{A}$ must be consistent with the knowlege partially specified in $A[\cdot]$, must start as it is observed in $O$, and must induce a temporal plan from $I$ that satisfies $G$. Intuitively, $\mathcal{A}$ is a solution if it explains the input observation and its subjacent temporal model implies no contradictions in the states induced by their execution.


As can be noticed, the partially specified model $A[\cdot]$ and the observations $O$ impose constraints that the learned model $\mathcal{A}$ must satisfy. Consequently, formulating a CSP to address the learning task and finding a consistent solution that explains that formulation seems a suitable approach to learn temporal models.  
  
  
\subsection{Example}
  \label{sec:simpleTask}
Given a partially specified model of actions $A[\cdot]$ and a single sequence of observations $O$, learning a temporal action model $\mathcal{A}$  may seem, a priori, a straightforward task as it \emph{just} implies to distribute the conditions+effects in time and estimate durations. However, this is untrue.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{small}
    \begin{tabular}{c| c| c}
\vspace{-4cm}\\
$\start(a)$ &$\pre(a)$ &$\eff(a)$ \\\hline
2 &$\pre(a1)=\{\}$ &$\eff(a1)=\{p,r\}$ \\
4 &$\pre(a2)=\{\}$ &$\eff(a2)=\{p,q\}$ \\
7 &$\pre(a3)=\{r\}$ &$\eff(a3)=\{\neg p\}$ \\
10 &$\pre(a4)=\{p,q,r\}$ &$\eff(a4)=\{\neg r\}$ \\    
  \end{tabular}
  \end{small}    
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ejemploacciones.png}
\caption{\small Example showing that learning a temporal action model from $A[\cdot]$ and $O$ is not straightforward. We know the plan makespan is 22, but depending on the distribution of conditions, effects and durations, many situations are possible, though some of them inconsistent.}
\label{fig:exampleplantrace}
\end{figure}


Let us suppose the example of Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleplantrace}, with all the conditions, effects and start times of actions. Clearly, $a3$ needs $a1$ to have $r$ supported, which represents the causal link or dependency $\tup{a1,r,a3}$. Let us imagine that $r$ is in $\cond_s(a3)$. In such a case, if $r$ is in $\eff_s(a1)$, $\dur(a1)$ is irrelevant to $a3$, but if $r$ is in $\eff_e(a1)$, $\dur(a1)$ has to be lower or equal than 5 ($\start(a1)+\dur(a1) \leq \start(a3)$). On the contrary, if $r$ is in $\cond_e(a3)$, $\dur(a1)$ could be much longer. Therefore, the distribution of conditions and effects has a significant impact in the durations, and vice versa.

Action $a4$ needs $p$, which means two possible causal links ($\tup{a1,p,a4}$ or $\tup{a2,p,a4}$). The real causal link will be the last to happen, and this depends on the effects+durations of $a1$ and $a2$. Therefore, the causal links are unknown, not easy to detect and they affect the structure of the temporal plan. But $a4$ really needs both $a1$ and $a2$ to have $p,q,r$ supported. Let us imagine that $p,q,r$ are in $\cond_s(a4)$ and $p,q$ in $\eff_e(a2)$; then $\dur(a2) \leq 6$. Even if we knew for sure that $\dur(a2)=6$ and $r$ was in $\eff_e(a1)$, we could never estimate the exact value of $\dur(a1)$, as any value in $]0..8]$ would be valid. Intuitively, an action has to wait until the last of its supports, but we cannot grant when the other supports happen; those supporting times and respective durations can never be assured. Therefore, in some situations the precise duration cannot be found and we can only provide values that make the model consistent.

On the other hand, $a3$ deletes $p$, which means that it might \emph{threat} the causal link $\tup{a1,p,a4}$ or $\tup{a2,p,a4}$. But again, this threat depends on the distribution of conditions+effects and the durations. For instance, if $\neg p$ is in $\eff_s(a3)$, then $a1$ or $a2$ must support $p$ after time 7 and before $a4$ requires it, which entails many consistent alternatives. On the contrary, if $p$ is in both $\eff_s(a1)$ and $\eff_s(a2)$, this plan trace is inconsistent as $a3$ deletes $p$ and no other action in the plan supports $p$ for $a4$. However, if $\neg p$ is in $\eff_e(a3)$, $\dur(a3) > 3$ and $p$ is in $\cond_s(a4)$, then no threat will occur in the plan. Therefore, causal links and threats can easily appear or disappear depending on the selected distributions and durations.

Finally, there are some philosophical questions without a clearly motivated answer. First, why some conditions are modeled as \emph{at start} and others as \emph{over all}? In \texttt{drive-truck} of Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleactions2}, why \texttt{(driving ?d ?t)} is required throughout the entire action but \texttt{(link ?from ?to)} only at its beginning? Apparently, the link between the two locations should remain all over the driving; so is this a wrong decision of the human modeler?
Second, why some effects are modeled as \emph{at start} and others as \emph{at end}? In \texttt{board-truck}, why is \texttt{(not (empty ?t))} happening at start and \texttt{(driving ?d ?t)} at end? Could it be in the opposite way?
Third, what happens if one action requires/supports what it deletes (see $a4$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleplantrace}, which might threat itself)? In such a case, the delete effect should happen later than its requirement/supporting.
Four, what happens if all effects are \emph{at start}? This makes little sense, as the duration of the actions would be undetermined and could potentially exceed the known plan horizon or makespan no matter the problem goals. In Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleplantrace}, if the effects of $a1$ and $a2$ are \emph{at start}, is it sensible to allow their durations to pass the limit of 22? In other words, once all plan goals are achieved, can the actions be executed beyond the plan makespan or they need to be cut off to such a value? This could potentially lead to an infinite number of models and overlapping situations, so it is not commonly accepted.

As can be noticed from above, learning a temporal action model is not simple, and many possible combinations are feasible provided they fit the constraints the model imposes.



\section{A CP Formulation to Learn Temporal Planning Models}
\label{sec:CPformulation}

Our approach is to create a single CSP that includes all the constraints the learning task requires. This includes: i) the observations on the start times; ii) the actions' conditions, effects and durations; and iii) the causal structure of the plan with the supports, to avoid threats and possible contradictory effects.

This formulation is inspired by previous work for the synthesis of temporal plans with CP\cite{garrido2009constraint} and is solver-independent. This means that any off-the-shelf CSP solver that supports the expressiveness of our formulation, with binary and non-binary constraints, can be used.

\subsection{The variables}
For each action $a$ in $A[\cdot]$, we create the seven kinds of variables specified in Table~\ref{table:variables}. These variables indicate the time-stamps for actions, the causal links, the interval when conditions must hold and the time when the effects happen. For simplicity, and to deal with integer variables, we model time in $\mathbb{Z}^+$. To prevent time from exceeding the plan horizon, we bound all times to the makespan of the plan\footnote{We use the makespan, which can be also observed, to restrict the duration of the actions. However, it is dispensable if we consider a long enough domain for durations.}.


This formulation is more expressive than PDDL2.1 (see more details in section~\ref{sec:PDDL21constraints} below) since it allows conditions and effects to be at any time, even outside the execution of the action. For instance, let us imagine a condition $p$ that only needs to be maintained for 5 time units before an action $a$ starts (e.g. warming-up a motor before driving): the expression $\reqe(p,a)=\start(a); \reqe(p,a) = \reqs(p,a)+5$ is possible in our formulation. Additionally, we can represent an effect $p$ that happens in the middle of action $a$: $\tim(p,a) = \start(a)+ (\dur(a) / 2)$ is also possible.


\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}p{2.7cm}p{7.4cm}}
Variable & Domain & Description \\

\hline

%\multicolumn{3}{l}{Vars. necessary for action times} \\

$\start(a)$ & \emph{known value} & start time of $a$ observed in $O$ \\
$\dur(a)$ & $[1..makespan]$ & duration of $a$. Optionally, it can be bounded by $makespan-\start(a)$\\
$\en(a)$ & \emph{derived value} & end time of $a$: $\en(a)=\start(a)+\dur(a)$ \\

%\multicolumn{3}{l}{Vars. necessary for action conditions+effects} \\

$\supp(p,a)$ & $\{b_i\}$ that \newline supports $p$ & symbolic variable for the set of potential supporters $b_i$ of condition $p$ of $a$ (causal link $\tup{b_i,p,a}$) \\

$\reqs(p,a)$, \\
$\reqe(p,a)$ & $[0..makespan]$ & interval $[\reqs(p,a)..\reqe(p,a)]$ at which action $a$ requires $p$ \\

$\tim(p,a)$ & $[0..makespan]$ & time when effect $p$ of $a$ happens \\


\hline
\end{tabular}
\normalsize
\end{center}
\caption{Formulation of the variables and their domains for an action $a\in A[\cdot]$.}
\label{table:variables}
\end{table}


Additionally, we create two dummy actions $\ini$ and $\goal$ for each planning problem $\tup{F,I,G,A[\cdot]}$. First, $\ini$ represents the initial state $I$ ($\start(\ini)=0$ and $\dur(\ini)=0$). $\ini$ has no variables $\supp, \reqs$ and $\reqe$ because it has no conditions. $\ini$ has as many $\tim(p_i,\ini)=0$ as $p_i$ in $I$. Second, $\goal$ represents $G$ ($\start(\goal)=makespan$ and $\dur(\goal)=0$). $\goal$ has as many $\supp(p_i,\goal)$ and $\reqs(p_i,\goal)=\reqe(p_i,\goal)=makespan$ as $p_i$ in $G$. $\goal$ has no variables $\tim$ as it has no effects.

%This formulation allows us to model TILs and observations exactly like other actions. On the one hand, $\til(f,t)$ can be seen as a dummy action ($\start(\til(f,t))=t$ and $\dur(\til(f,t))=0$) with no conditions and only one effect $f$ that happens at time $t$ ($\tim(f,\til(f,t))=t$). A $\til$ is analogous to $\ini$, as they both represent information that is given at a particular time, but externally to the execution of the plan. On the other hand, $\obs(f,t)$ can be seen as another dummy action ($\start(\obs(f,t))=t$ and $\dur(\obs(f,t))=0$) with only one condition $f$, which is the value observed for fact $f$, and no effects at all. An $\obs$ is analogous to $\goal$, as they both represent conditions that must be satisfied in the execution of the plan at a particular time.


\subsection{The constraints}

Table~\ref{table:constraints} shows the constraints that we define among the variables of Table~\ref{table:variables}. The three first constraints are trivial. The fourth constraint models the causal links. Note that in a causal link $\tup{b_i,p,a}$, $\tim(p,b_i) < \reqs(p,a)$ and not $\leq$. This is because temporal planning assumes an $\epsilon > 0$ as a small tolerance between the time when an effect $p$ is supported and when it is required~\cite{fox2003pddl2}. Since we model time in $\mathbb{Z}^+$, $\epsilon=1$ and $\leq$ becomes $<$.
The fifth constraint avoids any threat via promotion or demotion~\cite{ghallab2004automated}. The sixth constraint models the fact the same action requires and deletes $p$. Note the $\geq$ inequality here; this is possible because if one condition and one effect of $a$ happen at the same time, the underlying semantics of planning considers the condition is checked instantly before the effect. The seventh constraint solves the fact that two (possible equal) actions have contradictory effects. It is important to note that constraints involve any type of action, including $\ini$ and $\goal$.

\subsection{Specific constraints for PDDL2.1 durative actions}
\label{sec:PDDL21constraints}

As Section~\ref{sec:temporalplanning} explains, PDDL2.1 restricts the expressiveness of temporal planning in terms of conditions, effects, durations and structure of the actions. Our formulation is more expressive than PDDL2.1, but adding constraints to make it fully PDDL2.1-compliant is straightforward.


First, $((\reqs(p,a) = \start(a))$ OR ($\reqs(p,a) = \en(a)))$ AND $((\reqe(p,a) = \start(a))$ OR ($\reqe(p,a) = \en(a)))$ limits condition $p$ to be \emph{at start}, \emph{over all} or \emph{at end}, i.e. $p$ is in $\cond_s(a)$, $\cond_o(a)$ or $\cond_e(a)$, respectively.
Further, if a condition is never deleted in a plan, it can be considered as an invariant condition for such a plan. In other words, it represents static information. This type of condition is commonly used in planning to ease the grounding process from the operators; e.g. to model that there is a link between two locations and, consequently, a driving is possible, or modeling a petrol station that allows a refuel action in a given location, etc. Therefore, the constraint to be added for an invariant condition $p$ is simply: $((\reqs(p,a) = \start(a))$ AND $(\reqe(p,a) = \en(a)))$, i.e. $p \in \cond_o(a)$.

Surprisingly, invariant conditions are modeled differently depending on the human modeler. See, for instance, \texttt{(link ?from ?to)} of Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleactions2}, which is modeled as an \emph{at start} condition despite: i) no action can be planned to delete that link, and ii) the link should be necessary all over the driving.
This also happens in the \emph{transport} domain of the IPC, where a refuel action requires to have a petrol station in a location only \emph{at start}, rather than \emph{over all} which makes more sense. This shows that modeling a planning domain is not easy and it highly depends on human's decision. On the contrary, our formulation checks the invariant conditions and deals with them always in the same coherent way.


Second, $((\tim(p,a) = \start(a))$ OR $(\tim(p,a) = \en(a)))$ makes an effect $p$ happen only \emph{at start} or \emph{at end} of action $a$, i.e. $p$ is in $\eff_s(a)$ or $\eff_e(a)$.
Also, if all effects happen \emph{at start} the duration of the action would be irrelevant and could exceed the plan makespan. To avoid this, for any action $a$, at least one of its effects should happen \emph{at end}: $\sum_{i=1}^{n =|\eff(a)|} \tim(p_i,a) > n \cdot \start(a)$, which guarantees $\eff_e(a)$ is not empty.

%\begin{displaymath}
%\sum_{i=1}^{n = \textrm{number of effects of }a} \tim(p_i,a) > n \cdot \start(a)
%\end{displaymath}


Third, durations in PDDL2.1 can be defined in two different ways. On the one hand, durations can be equal for all grounded actions of the same operator. For instance, any instantiation of \texttt{board-truck} of Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleactions2} will last 2 time units no matter its parameters. Although this may seem a bit odd, it is not an uncommon practice to simplify the model. The constraint to model this is: $\forall a_i,a_j$ being instances of the same operator: $\dur(a_i) = \dur(a_j)$. On the other hand, although different instantiations of \texttt{drive-truck} will last different depending on the locations, different occurrences of the same instantiated action will last equal.

In a PDDL2.1 temporal plan, multiple occurrences of \texttt{drive-truck(truck1,loc1,loc2,driver1)} will have the same duration no matter when they start. Intuitively, they are different occurrences of the same action, but in the real-world the durations would differ from driving at night or in peak times. Since PDDL2.1 makes no distinction among different occurrences, the constraint to add is: $\forall a_i,a_j$ being occurrences of the same durative action: $\dur(a_i) = \dur(a_j)$.
Obviously, this second constraint is subsumed by the first one in the general case where all instances of the same operator have the same duration.

Four, the structure of conditions and effects for all grounded actions of the same operator is constant in PDDL2.1. This means that if \texttt{(empty ?t)} is an \emph{at start} condition of \texttt{board-truck}, it will be \emph{at start} in any of its grounded actions.
Let $\{p_i\}$ be the conditions of an operator and $\{a_j\}$ be the instances of a particular operator. The following constraints are necessary to guarantee equal structure:

$\forall p_i: (\forall a_j: \reqs(p_i,a_j) = \start(a_j))$ OR $(\forall a_j: \reqs(p_i,a_j) = \en(a_j))$

$\forall p_i: (\forall a_j: \reqe(p_i,a_j) = \start(a_j))$ OR $(\forall a_j: \reqe(p_i,a_j) = \en(a_j))$

And analogously for all effects $\{p_i\}$ and the instances $\{a_j\}$ of an operator:

$\forall p_i: (\forall a_j: \tim(p_i,a_j) = \start(a_j))$ OR $(\forall a_j: \tim(p_i,a_j) = \en(a_j))$


As a conclusion, in our formulation each action of $A[\cdot]$ is modeled separately so it does not need to share the same structure or duration of other actions. Moreover, the time-stamps for conditions/effects can be arbitrarily placed inside or outside the execution of the action, which allows for a flexible and expressive temporal model. But, when necessary, we can simply include additional constraints to restrict the expressiveness of the model, such as the ones provided by PDDL2.1.


\subsection{Example}
\label{sec:example}

We now show a fragment of the formulation for the example depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleplantrace}. For simplicity, we only show the variables and constraints for action $a3$, but the formulation is analogous for all other actions.

The variables and domains are: $\start(a3)=7$; $\dur(a3) \in [1..15]$; $\en(a3)=\start(a3)+\dur(a3)$; $\supp(r,a3) \in \{a1\}$; $\reqs(r,a3),\reqe(r,a3) \in [0..22]$; and $\tim(\neg p,a3) \in [0..22]$.
On the other hand, the constraints are: $\en(a3) \leq \start(\goal)$; $\reqs(r,a3) \leq \reqe(r,a3)$; if $\supp(r,a3)=a1$ then $\tim(r,a1) < \reqs(r,a3)$; if $\supp(r,a3)=a1$ then $((\tim(\neg r,a4) < \tim(r,a1))$ OR $(\tim(\neg r,a4) > \reqe(r,a3)))$; $\tim(\neg p,a3) \neq \tim(p,a1)$ and $\tim(\neg p,a3) \neq \tim(p,a2)$.

There are many consistent solutions for this simple example, mainly because there is a huge range of possible durations that make the learned model consistent with the partially specified model $A[\cdot]$.
Fig.~\ref{figure:solutionsExample} shows six arbitrary solutions. What is important to note is that the structure, i.e. distribution of conditions/effects, is similar in all the solutions. Actually, the distribution of the effects is identical except in solution 2 for $q$, and the distribution of conditions is very similar (e.g. $q$ is always in $\cond_o$ and $r$ in $a4$ is very often in $\cond_e$).
This shows that the one-shot learning, using only one sample, returns not only consistent models but also similar, which is very positive.
The durations are, however, more different: $\dur(a1)$ ranges in the shown solutions from 7 to 19, whereas $\dur(a2)$ ranges from 5 to 18. As explained in section~\ref{sec:simpleTask}, learning the precise duration from just one sample may not be always possible, which is the main limitation of the one-shot learning task.
Clearly, the duration learned for only one sample of \texttt{drive-truck(truck1,loc1,loc2,driver1)} cannot be always generalized to any other driving between these two locations.
In fact, the specific constraint of PDDL2.1, with regard to having multiple occurrences of the same action having the same duration, can significantly help us to learn the actions' duration in a more precise way as the learned duration must be consistent with all those occurrences.

\subsection{Implementation. Use of Heuristics for Resolution}
\label{sec:implementation}

Our CSP formulation is automatically compiled from a partially specified action model, as defined in a classical planning problem, and the observations from a plan execution.
The formulation has been implemented in \textsf{Choco}\footnote{\texttt{http://www.choco-solver.org}}, an open-source Java library for constraint programming that provides an object-oriented API to state the constraints to be satisfied.

Our formulation is solver-independent, which means we do not use heuristics that may require changes in the implementation of the CSP engine.
Although this can reduce the CSP resolution performance, we are interested in using the solver as a blackbox that can be easily changed with no modification in our formulation. However, we can easily encode standard static heuristics for variable and value selection that help improve efficiency by following the next ordering, which has shown very efficient in our experiments:

%%IMPORTANTE: ahorramos espacio juntando en la vi√±eta el orden de seleccion de variables y de valores

%From the variable perspective, we have detected it is better to instantiate variables that first lead to failure: effects, conditions, supporters and durations. This implies this ordering: $\tim$, $\reqs$, $\reqe$, $\supp$ and $\dur$.
%From the value perspective, we select first the values that lead to a more reasonable model of actions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Effects ($\tim$). For negative effects, first the lower value and for positive effects, first the upper value. This gives priority to delete effects as $\eff_s(a)$ and positive effects as $\eff_e(a)$.
  \item Conditions ($\reqs$ and $\reqe$). For $\reqs$, first the lower value, whereas for $\reqe$, first the upper value. This gives priority to $\cond_o(a)$, trying to keep the conditions as long as possible.
  \item Supporters ($\supp$). First the lower value, thus preferring the supporter that starts earlier in the plan.
  \item Duration ($\dur$). First the lower value, thus applying the principle of the shortest actions that make the learned model consistent.
\end{enumerate}


%This simple collection of heuristics is very intuitive and has been used in \textsf{Choco} by simply overriding the default search strategy for the variable and value selectors. Although these heuristics have shown very efficient in our experiments, they cannot always guarantee the best performance.


\subsection{Using the CP Formulation for Validation}
\label{sec:usingCPValidation}

As seen above, adding constraints allows us to restrict the temporal expressiveness of the learned model.
But we can also restrict the learned model by constraining the variables to known values, which is specially interesting when there is additional information on the temporal model that needs to be represented. For instance, based on past learned models, we may know the precise duration of an action $a$,
%or we can figure out that a condition is a start condition
or we can figure out that an effect $p$ always happens at end.
Our CP formulation can include this by simply adding $\dur(a)=value$ and $\tim(p,a)=\en(a)$, which is useful to enrich the partially specified actions in $A[\cdot]$ of the learning task.


In particular, the possibility of adding these constraints is very appealing when used for validating whether a partial action model is consistent, as we will see in section~\ref{sec:evaluation}.
Let us assume that the distribution of all (or just a few) conditions and/or effects is known and, consequently, represented in the learning task. If a learned model is found, then that structure of conditions/effects is consistent for the learned model. On the contrary, if no solution is found that structure is inconsistent and cannot be explained.
Analogously, we can represent known values of the durations. If a solution is found the durations are consistent, or inconsistent otherwise.
Hence, we have (at least) three options for validating a partial model \emph{w.r.t.}: i) a known structure with the distribution of conditions/effects; ii) a known set of durations; and iii) a known structure plus a known set of durations (i+ii).
The first and second option allows for some flexibility in the learning task because some variables remain open. However, the third option checks whether a learned model can fit the given constraints, thus reproducing a strict validation task similar to~\cite{howey2004val}.



\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
This sections shows the empirical evaluation of our CP approach for the one-shot learning of temporal action models.

\subsection{Domains}
Our learning method is evaluated at eight different temporal planning domains, all taken from the IPC and encoded in PDDL2.1 (so we have included the constraints introduced in section~\ref{sec:PDDL21constraints}). Table~\ref{table:evaluationExperiments} reports the number of actions schema for each domain.

\subsection{Evaluation metric}
The evaluation of the learned action models can be addressed from a pure syntactic perspective, comparing the learned models to a {\em ground truth model}. The success of the learning is given by an accuracy metric that asseses how similar is a learned model wrt the ground truth (e.g.~counting the number of differences in terms of incorrect conditions/effects and durations).

In real problems there is no {\em ground truth model}. Further, pure syntactic metrics are often too pesimist since they account as incorrect a different duration or distribution of conditions/effects that actually represents an equivalent reformulation of the reference model. For instance, given the example of Fig.~\ref{fig:exampleactions2}, the condition learned \texttt{(over all (link ?from ?to))} would be counted as a difference in action \texttt{drive-truck} (as it is \texttt{at start} in the reference model), but it is, semantically speaking, more correct. Analogously, some durations may differ from the reference model but they should not be counted as incorrect. As seen in section~\ref{subsec:simpleTask}, some learned durations cannot be granted, but the underlying model is still consistent. 

Our approach for the evaluation is assesing the quality of the learned models with respect to its performance on a test dataset of unseen temporal planning problems. The success of learned models is assessed by analyzing the success ratio of a learned model in all temporal planning instances in the test dataset and define the success ratio as the percentage of samples of the test dataset that are consistent with the learned model. A higher ratio means that the learned model explains, or adequately fits, the observed constraints the test dataset imposes.

\subsection{Setup}
For each of the domains we first build a test data set of plans using these five planners (\textit{LPG-Quality}, \textit{LPG-Speed}\cite{gerevini2003planning}, \textit{TP}~\cite{jimenez2015temporal}, \textit{TFD}~\cite{eyerich2009using} and \textit{TFLAP}~\cite{marzal2016temporal}), where the planning time is limited to 100 seconds.

For each plan in the test data set we create the CP formulation and we run the one-shot learning task to get a temporal action model, where the learning time is limited to 100s on an Intel i5-6400 @ 2.70GHz with 8GB of RAM. To evaluate the quality of each learned model, we validate it \emph{vs.} the other models \emph{w.r.t.} the structure, the duration and the structure+duration. For instance, the \emph{zenotravel} domain contains 78 instances, which means that we learn 78 models. Each model is validated by using the 77 remaining models, thus producing 78$\times$77=6006 validations per struct, dur and struct+dur each. Table~\ref{table:evaluationExperiments} reports the average success ratio.

\subsection{Experimental results}
In \emph{zenotravel}, the struct value means the distribution of conditions/effects learned by using only one plan sample is consistent with all (100\%) the samples used as dataset, which is the perfect value. The dur value means the durations learned explain 68.83\% of the dataset. The struct+dur value means that the learned model explains entirely 35.76\% of the samples. As seen in Table~\ref{table:evaluationExperiments}, the results are specially good, taking into consideration that we use only one sample to learn the temporal action model. The results depend on the domain size (number of operators, which need to be grounded), the relationships (causal links, threats and interferences) among the actions, and the quality of the plans.  Some planners return plans with unnecessary actions, which has a negative impact for learning precise durations.

The worst result is returned in the \emph{rovers} domain, which models a group of planetary rovers to explore the planet they are on. Since there are many parallel actions for taking pictures/samples and navigation of multiple rovers, learning the duration is particularly complex in this domain.

\section{Conclusions through Related Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

[INCLUIR AQUI RELATED WORK]

We have presented a purely declarative CP formulation that is independent of any CSP solver to address the learning of temporal action models.
The main contribution is a simple formulation that is automatically derived from the actions and observations on each plan execution, without the necessity of specific hand-coded domain knowledge. It is also flexible to support a very expressive temporal planning model, though it can be easily modified to be PDDL2.1-compliant.
Unlike other approaches that need to learn from datasets with many samples, we perform one-shot learning. This reduces both the size of the required datasets and the computation time. The learned models are very good and explain a high number of samples in the datasets used for testing. Moreover, the same formulation is valid for learning and for validation by simply adding constraints to the variables. This is an advantage, as the same formulation allows us to carry out different tasks: from entirely learning, partial learning/validation (structure and/or duration) to entirely planning validation.
According to our experiments, learning the structure of the actions in a one-shot way leads to representative enough models, but learning the precise durations is more difficult, and even impossible when many actions are executed in parallel.


Finally, it is important to note that our formulation can be also solved by SATisfiability Modulo Theories, which is part of our current work. As future work, we want to extend our formulation to learn a more complete action model. Rather than using a partially specified set of actions in $A[\cdot]$, we want to find out the conditions/effects together with their distribution.
The underlying idea of finding an action model consistent with all the constraints will remain the same, but the model will need to be extended with additional constraints and boolean variables $\mathsf{is\_condition(p,a)}$, $\mathsf{is\_effect(p,a)}$ to decide whether $p$ is a condition or effect of action $a$.





%In this paper we face the learning task by means of constraint programming and propose a simple but effective CSP formulation to learn temporal planning models regarding the partial observations of the execution of a single temporal plan.
%The main contributions are: i) a simple formulation that is automatically derived from the actions and observations on each plan execution, without the necessity of specific hand-coded domain knowledge; ii) a flexible formulation that supports a very expressive temporal planning model, though it can be easily modified to be PDDL2.1-compliant; iii)

%We use the same model of action to represent all elements of temporal planning, including TILs and observations.
%The timed initial literals can be interpreted as simple actions that are forced into the respective happenings (rather than selected into them by the planner), whose precondition is true, and whose only effect is the respective literal.
